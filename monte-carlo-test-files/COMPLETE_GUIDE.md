# Monte Carlo Investment Simulator - Complete Package

## 📦 What's Included

This package contains a complete Monte Carlo simulation tool for investment projections, inspired by the methodology used by HonestMath.com.

### Core Files

1. **monte_carlo_simulator_v2.py** - Main simulation engine
2. **simple_cli.py** - User-friendly command-line interface
3. **QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference guide
4. **This file** - Comprehensive documentation

### Generated Outputs

- `monte_carlo_simulation.png` - Standard 30-year projection
- `distribution_comparison.png` - Fat-tailed vs Normal comparison
- `high_risk_simulation.png` - Aggressive investment scenario

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### 1. Fat-Tailed Distributions
Unlike traditional Monte Carlo tools that assume returns follow a normal "bell curve," this simulator uses **fat-tailed distributions** (Student's t-distribution). This is critical because:

- **Real markets have more extreme events** than normal distributions predict
- The 2008 financial crisis, COVID crash, and 1987 Black Monday were all "fat tail" events
- Normal distributions underestimate the risk of crashes

**Comparison:**
```
Normal Distribution:
  - Extreme events: Very rare
  - Market crashes: Underestimated
  - Used by: Most traditional tools

Fat-Tailed Distribution (This Tool):
  - Extreme events: More realistic
  - Market crashes: Properly captured
  - Used by: HonestMath, sophisticated institutions
```

### 2. Monthly Calculations
- Most tools calculate returns annually
- This tool models month-by-month for accuracy
- Better represents dollar-cost averaging
- More realistic contribution timing

### 3. Robust Statistics
- 10,000 simulation trials (not just a few hundred)
- Statistically significant results
- Percentile bands show full range of outcomes

## 📊 How It Works

### The Math Behind It

**Traditional Approach:**
```python
return ~ Normal(μ=8%, σ=18%)
# Assumes returns follow bell curve
# Problem: Underestimates extreme events
```

**This Tool's Approach:**
```python
return ~ StudentT(df=5, loc=8%, scale=18%)
# Uses t-distribution with fat tails
# Better: Captures real market volatility
```

### The Simulation Process

1. **Generate Random Returns**
   - 10,000 different return sequences
   - Each sequence = one possible future
   - Uses fat-tailed distribution

2. **Calculate Monthly**
   ```
   Month 1: (Initial + Contribution) × (1 + Return₁)
   Month 2: (Month1 + Contribution) × (1 + Return₂)
   ...
   Month 360: Final portfolio value
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Sort all 10,000 final values
   - Find percentiles (10th, 20th, 50th, 80th, 90th)
   - Calculate success rates

## 🚀 Three Ways to Use

### Method 1: Simple CLI (Easiest)
```bash
python simple_cli.py
```
Follow the prompts - no coding required!

### Method 2: Python Script (More Control)
```python
from monte_carlo_simulator_v2 import MonteCarloInvestmentSimulator

sim = MonteCarloInvestmentSimulator(
    initial_balance=10000,
    monthly_contribution=500,
    annual_return=0.08,
    annual_volatility=0.18,
    years=30
)

sim.run_simulation()
sim.print_summary()
sim.plot_results()
```

### Method 3: Jupyter Notebook (Best for Exploration)
```python
# Run multiple scenarios easily
scenarios = {
    'Conservative': {'return': 0.06, 'volatility': 0.12},
    'Moderate': {'return': 0.08, 'volatility': 0.16},
    'Aggressive': {'return': 0.10, 'volatility': 0.22}
}

for name, params in scenarios.items():
    sim = MonteCarloInvestmentSimulator(
        initial_balance=50000,
        monthly_contribution=1000,
        annual_return=params['return'],
        annual_volatility=params['volatility'],
        years=20
    )
    sim.run_simulation()
    print(f"\n{name} Scenario:")
    sim.print_summary()
```

### Example 1: Recent College Grad
**Profile:** Age 25, starting career, long time horizon

```python
sim = MonteCarloInvestmentSimulator(
    initial_balance=5000,        # Small starter amount
    monthly_contribution=400,     # Modest contributions
    annual_return=0.09,          # 90% stocks
    annual_volatility=0.20,      # High risk tolerance
    years=40                     # Long runway
)
```

**Typical Results:**

sim = MonteCarloInvestmentSimulator(
    initial_balance=75000,       # Some savings
    monthly_contribution=1500,    # Serious saver
    annual_return=0.08,          # 70/30 stocks/bonds
    annual_volatility=0.17,      
    years=25

    monthly_contribution=3000,    # Final push
    annual_return=0.06,          # 40/60 stocks/bonds
    annual_volatility=0.12,      # Lower risk
    years=7
)
```

**Typical Results:**
- Median outcome: ~$950K
- 20th percentile: ~$830K
- 80th percentile: ~$1.1M

## 🎓 Understanding the Results

### Reading the Visualization

The main chart shows:
- **Blue shaded area**: Range of likely outcomes
- **Dark blue line**: Median (50/50 outcome)
- **Gray lines**: Sample individual trials
- **Wider band**: More uncertainty
- **Narrower band**: More certainty

### Interpreting Percentiles

| Percentile | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| 90th | Only 10% of outcomes better than this (very lucky) |
| 80th | 20% better, 80% worse (optimistic but realistic) |
| 50th (Median) | Half better, half worse (middle outcome) |
| 20th | 80% better, 20% worse (pessimistic but realistic) |
| 10th | Only 10% worse than this (very unlucky) |

### HonestMath's Success Criterion

> "If at least 80% of your trials end with a positive portfolio balance, you're in good shape."

This means: Focus on the **20th percentile**. If even the unlucky scenarios work out, you're well-positioned.

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adjusting Risk Profile

**Conservative (Age 60+):**
```python
annual_return=0.05      # 30/70 stocks/bonds
annual_volatility=0.10
```

**Moderate (Age 40-60):**
```python
annual_return=0.07      # 60/40 stocks/bonds
annual_volatility=0.14
```

**Aggressive (Age 20-40):**
```python
annual_return=0.09      # 90/10 stocks/bonds
annual_volatility=0.19
```

### Adjusting Tail Severity

```python
# Standard (normal market volatility)
tail_severity='standard'  # df=5 in t-distribution

# Extreme (includes severe crashes)
tail_severity='extreme'   # df=3 in t-distribution
```

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### What This Tool DOES:
✅ Model investment growth with realistic volatility
✅ Show range of possible outcomes
✅ Account for extreme market events
✅ Provide statistical confidence

### What This Tool DOESN'T:
❌ Guarantee any specific outcome
❌ Model taxes (can be added)
❌ Account for inflation adjustments
❌ Include advisor fees
❌ Predict the future

### Key Assumptions:
1. Returns follow historical patterns
2. Contributions remain constant
3. No withdrawals until end
4. Markets remain similar to past
5. No behavioral factors (panic selling, etc.)

## 📚 Technical Details

### Student's t-Distribution

The key innovation is using Student's t-distribution:

```
Probability Density Function:
f(x) = Γ((ν+1)/2) / (√(νπ) Γ(ν/2)) × (1 + x²/ν)^(-(ν+1)/2)

Where ν = degrees of freedom (controls tail fatness)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ν = ∞ → Normal distribution (thin tails)
- ν = 5 → Moderately fat tails (realistic)
- ν = 3 → Very fat tails (stress test)

### Monthly Compounding

```python
for month in range(total_months):
    # Add monthly contribution
    balance += monthly_contribution
    
    # Apply random return
    return_this_month = generate_random_return()
    balance *= (1 + return_this_month)
```

This accurately models:
- Dollar-cost averaging
- Compound growth
- Monthly rebalancing

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Run Multiple Scenarios**
   - Optimistic, realistic, pessimistic
   - Different time horizons
   - Various contribution levels

2. **Focus on 20-80 Percentile Range**
   - This is your "realistic" band
   - Ignore extreme outliers
   - Plan for 20th percentile

3. **Use Fat Tails**
   - More realistic than normal
   - Better risk assessment
   - Prepares for crashes

4. **Update Annually**
   - Rerun with actual performance
   - Adjust assumptions
   - Track progress

5. **Don't Over-Optimize**
   - These are projections, not predictions
   - Markets are uncertain
   - Build in safety margin
